20. React Challenge: React Portfolio

## Description 

Being a web developer means being part of a community. We all need a place to share our projects not only if we're applying for jobs or working as a freelancer but also so that we can share our work with fellow developers and collaborate on future projects.

AS AN employer looking for candidates with experience building single-page applications
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed React portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position

GIVEN a single-page application portfolio for a web developer
WHEN I load the portfolio
THEN I am presented with a page containing a header, a section for content, and a footer

WHEN I view the navigation titles
THEN I am presented with the titles About Me, Portfolio, Contact, and Resume, and the title corresponding to the current section is highlighted
